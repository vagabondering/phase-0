- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was really interesting and fun to see the changes in effect right away.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
It was great to use the HTML Validation Tool, it was helpful in terms of pointing out errors and bugs that needed to be addressed.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I think I did decent.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
The good part about HTML is that it's a simple and straightforward language and the results are quick to see. The bad part is that it can become a bit messy and hard to read if the html content is large.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
One of my trick is to remember to always have have a beginning and closing tag.
