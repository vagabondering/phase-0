-What does puts do?
Puts evaluates the code to nil and prints the output to the console.

-What is an integer? What is a float?
Integer is a whole number. Float is a number with fractions/decimals.

-What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?An integer division only outputs a whole rounded number, which means it doesn't give an accurate result as a float would be, providing the decimals.

```ruby
day = 24
year = 365
hours_year = year * 24
decade = 10
hour = 60
minute_decade = decade * ((hour * day) * year)

print "There are "
print hours_year
puts " hours in a year"
print "There are "
print minute_decade
print " mintues in a decade"
```

Reflect:

-How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers? Ruby handles all of those really well, you can use irb to experiment and perform these calculations interactively.


-What is the difference between integers and floats?
The difference is that float value is decimated/fractioned.

-What is the difference between integer and float division?
The difference is that the result is a whole in integer divison but fractioned in a float division.

-What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
Strings are groups of letters in a program and I would use it whenever I want to use letters or symbols.

-What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
local variable is a variable declared within the function, that can only be used within that function.

-How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
The math challenge was fun, I did struggle a bit with the variables exercise but it was because I was confused by the wording of the assignment.
