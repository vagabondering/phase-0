//User Story by kevin

// As a user, I want to be able to input any list of numbers and find the following values for the items in the list: the SUM, the MEAN and the MEDIAN.  The input can be a list of numbers with an odd or even length, but if the length of the list is even, the median needs to return a float value of the middle of the list (for example, a list containting 1, 2, 3, and 4 would return 2.5 as a median.)

 // User Stories to Pseudocode by Li-Lian

 // Create object that takes an input of array.

 // Create function for SUM that takes the array object as an argument. Use for loop to iterate through each array element:
 // For var num equal zero, stop when less than array length and then increments by 1. Add numbers up to get SUM.

 // For MEAN function, divide total of SUM by length of input array object to calculate MEAN.

 // For MEDIAN function,
 // If the length of the array object is even, find the two middle elements, sum them up and and divide it by two.
 // else
  // Find middle element of the array and divide it by two.
