    -How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

    The inspector allows me access DOM to format the elements as live-edit.


    -How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

    I can resize elements using width and length attributes and tweaking the values.


    -What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
    Static position is the default positon where elements stacks in an order of one after another.

    Absolute means the element is positioned in relative to its parent that has position set to relative.
    Relative position allows the element to be positioned in relative to its static position and can be moved around without affecting other elements.
    I found all of them were difficult to use because I didn't have a clear understanding of each until now.


    -What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?

    Margin is the spacing around the element, border is the edge of the element and padding is the space between the content and border.


    -What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

    I loved this because I can see the edits live, which allows me to experiment around and test to see what each attribute does.
