        Having to learn Git, a versioning control workflow, I can see how great the benefits are in usage for coding. As coding is highly experimental, the work can be saved and backed constantly with incremented versions. Having the code backed up gives you the freedom to add and test codes, without having to worry about breaking anything because you can quickly revert to the latest working version. Git allows you to compare the versions with each other so you can see the content differences.
        It's also a great way to analyze and see the growth of the code workflow.

        Git commit is the process of saving the work and turning it to its own version. Each version becomes a backup of the code.
        You have to tie a message with the Git commit process. The content of the message should be clear and descriptive about the changes made to the code. If your code is being merged with another's, it's essential that the coder understands the changes.

      <p>
        On top of using Git, there's also GitHub. GitHub is an online hub that connects Git users to share and merge their codes. It also acts as a cloud storage for the codes with room to do several incremented saved versions.

    -What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
    So far I've used <header>, <footer> and <main> most often and will continue to since it helps me categorize and organize the sections.

    -How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
    The elements get laid out like a tree node on a page, with parent and child sections and with an open and close tag. The order starts with from top to bottom for the elements.


    -What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
    I learned that I can create a template for html using sublime snippet, which is so useful. I would definitely want to create more snippets later for other languages.
