How to create a repository on GitHub:
Navigate and find the plus icon, click on New Repository. Fill out the name and choose appropriate settings then click on "Create repository". After it gets created, navigate to the repository if not already there and find the cloning url. Copy (ctrl+c) the url, then in the shell type in:
$ git copy pasted_url_link

Open source means having access to the source code and being able to change and customize the sourced program.

I think open source is a great way for people to customize it to their own use and optionally share it. I can see that if this was my code, how it can be scary to have it available for everyone but I think it can be an advantage to involve other creative ideas. As long as people don't go crazy and abuse the code, it could potentially be utopia.

Using licences is important because it offers protection, giving you the original copyright for your work so no one else can claim your work as theirs.

The concept of creating another branch in git became more solidifed for me, giving me an aha for the overall git process. I intially struggled to understand branches and using it but I got a better understanding now.

I used stackoverflow a lot for other information. I used it to research more about HEAD and branches.
