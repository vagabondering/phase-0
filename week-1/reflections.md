# 1.1 Think about Time Reflection
I learned about time boxing, pomodoro technique, create a habit, meditation, how mindfulness can improve productivity and counter-intuitive productivity.
I can absolutely use time boxing for Phase 0, I'm doing that right now by timing myself to allow as much and how quickly I can write this in 15 minutes. Ok I cheated a bit, I went over by few minutes.

I'm not managing my time right now in the best way this week. I'm trying to fit this in with work, exercising, planning upcoming events and having a friend in town visiting and it just ends up with me going to bed later and sacrificing sleep. This strategy works on getting things done but not very well in terms of mental and physical health. However, my strategy of meditation and being mindful are working well because I'm not stressed out right now and instead I'm able to focus on improvements - these two strategies will definitely continue!

My overall plan for Phase 0 time management will be continuing focusing on being mindful and learning to meditate to not become overwhelmed with stress and anxiety and using time boxing strategy for certain tasks to just help me speed up my thought process and actions and learn to utilize my learning time in a more efficient manner.

## 1.2 The Command Line Reflection
Shell is the window interface for unix to operate and execute command lines. Bash is the unix command language.

I'm lucky to have past experience with unix from work so there wasn't much of a challenge so far for me in the material. I've used all the commands in the past except for the pipe and redirection ones. I think it's important to know how to navigate around comfortably and fast using cd, ../, ls and pwd.. It's also good to be familiar with the executable and writable files situation and how to change the permission using chmod +x and +w.

pwd - shows current directory and location

ls - list of content

mv - move the file to different location or name

cd - enter a directory/location

../ -  go up a directory

touch - create new item/file

mkdir - create new directory

less - shows limited chunk of information

rmdir - removes/delete directory

rm - removes/deletes file

help - provides more information and options about the command.
