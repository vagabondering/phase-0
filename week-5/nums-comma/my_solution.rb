# Numbers to Commas Solo Challenge

# I spent [] hours on this challenge.

# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.

# 0. Pseudocode

# What is the input?
# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?


# 1. Initial Solution




# 2. Refactored Solution




# 3. Reflection

# What was your process for breaking the problem down? What different approaches did you consider?


# Was your pseudocode effective in helping you build a successful initial solution?


# What new Ruby method(s) did you use when refactoring your solution? Describe your experience of using the Ruby documentation to implement it/them (any difficulties, etc.). Did it/they significantly change the way your code works? If so, how?


# How did you initially iterate through the data structure?


# Do you feel your refactored solution is more readable than your initial solution? Why?
